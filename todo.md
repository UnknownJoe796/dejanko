# To Do

- [ ] Test app in Django for integration testing
- [ ] Reverse Foreign Key
- [ ] Password Hashing / Password Field
  - [ ] Must match Django, allowing user created with Django to log in with Kotlin
     - [Django's docs on how passwords are stored](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/passwords/)
- [ ] Many-to-many fields
- [ ] File Fields
  - [ ] Multiple backing services with NIO2
    - [Generic Interface in Java 7](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/spi/FileSystemProvider.html)
    - [S3 library already exists](https://github.com/Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2)
- [ ] Sessions with Redis [(see here)](https://ktor.io/docs/storages.html#custom_storage)
- [ ] Structured Database Queries
  - [ ] Query
    - [ ] Where
    - [ ] Select (partial)
    - [ ] Joins (?)
    - [ ] Order By
    - [ ] Expressions
  - [ ] Insert
  - [ ] Update
  - [ ] Upsert
  - [ ] Delete
- [ ] Language Passing
  - Essentially, we need a way to have a cross-language request in both directions.
  - [ ] Kotlin to Python
  - [ ] Python to Kotlin
- [ ] Signals
  - [ ] Pre-save, post-save
  - [ ] Pre-delete, post-delete
  - [ ] Cross from Kotlin to Python using language passing
  - [ ] Cross from Python to Kotlin using language passing
- [ ] Admin
  - [ ] Root / models organized by app
  - [ ] List
    - [ ] Row-sized instance summary
    - [ ] Filters
    - [ ] Search (?)
    - [ ] Pagination
    - [ ] Multi-instance operations
  - [ ] Detail
    - [ ] Form fields for:
      - [ ] Numbers
      - [ ] Text Fields
      - [ ] File Fields
      - [ ] Password Fields
      - [ ] Foreign-key Fields
      - [ ] Many-to-many Fields
      - [ ] Reverse Fields?
    - [ ] Insert
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Delete
- [ ] Migrations
  - [ ] `makemigrations` equivalent
  - [ ] `migrate` equivalent
- [ ] Auto-generate Kotlin models from Django project
  - [ ] Use [`_meta` API](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/meta/)
  - [ ] Also dump relevant settings
- [ ] Access security rules as annotations by field
  - [ ] Defined per-field with an annotation
  - [ ] Built-in concept of ownership?
- [ ] Automatic API 
  - [ ] Generates list endpoint
    - [ ] Filters added automatically for indexed fields
    - [ ] Complex filters (`or`, other expressions...)
  - [ ] Generates detail endpoint
  - [ ] Data Joining for list and detail
    - [ ] Foreign Keys / Reverses
    - [ ] Many-to-many fields  
  - [ ] Generates post endpoint
  - [ ] Generates put endpoint
  - [ ] Generates patch endpoint
  - [ ] Generates delete endpoint
  - [ ] Generates documentation endpoint
